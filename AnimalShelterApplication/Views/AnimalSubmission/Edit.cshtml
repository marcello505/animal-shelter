        <h5>Info</h5>
        <p>
            On this page you can fill out a form to edit an animal submission. You should fill in all the boxes so that we know as much as possible before we consider
            adopting your animal. After you've edited the form you can view it under the "My Animal Submissions" tab as per usual. After we've looked at your submission we will contact
            you either for an appointment or for a denial of your submission.
